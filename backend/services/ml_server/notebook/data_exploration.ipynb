These services generally relate to having AA personnel work on EWS projects on Enron property (in our offices).  I have asked GSS if we have any global agreement that would cover this, but have been advised that the only AA agreement we have is an old one that has probably been rolled in to the Accenture LLP group - which is an offshoot AA and, as I understand it, not affiliated with AA any longer.\n",

One concern is the firing of the learner who performs  bad in the final two scenarios. Do we face any copyright issues using the CNN type themes? In addition, I think we need to stay clear of anything that remotely seems like California or anything that really happen with Enron? (i.e. So-cal Waha) In addition, comments on regulatory issues may be a problem (i.e. California Legislature).\n",

      "Kristin Walsh, a manager in Competitive Analysis, is returning from maternity leave on October 15th.  During Kristin's absence, the following changes have occurred in the group, and I just wanted to run them by you before we communicate them to her:\n",
      "1)  Kristin will only have two direct reports instead of three.\n",
      "2) Previously, Kristin's team as a whole was responsible for providing ENA (i.e. John and Louise, as well as traders) with competitive intelligence.  Instead of Kristen just overseeing the ENA process as a whole, Kristin and her two team members will have more specific duties, although Kristin will still be the primary point of contact for ENA.  Specifically, Kristin will gather and provide intelligence info for the Gas Team, and Kelly Holman will gather and provide info for East Power, and  Greg Whitman will do the same for West Power.  Robert Johnston, Kristin's supervisor,  and Scott Tholan, BUL, just felt like the level of service that Kristin's team was providing was not adequate because efforts were duplicated and Kristin could not provide enough \"face time\" with the head traders to gather and relay info, as well as directing her team.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Also,after Kristin's departure, it was learned that Kristen signed a contract for which she had no authority. Although Scott does not think that this has happened before, this particular contract blew up in their face.\n",

      "Upon Kristin's return, Scottt, Robert, and I would like to communicate these changes to her (not in writing, just verbally), and just reitterate the fact that only Scott has the authority to sign contracts.  Additionally, we would like to tell Kristin that she needs to take a management training class so that she can learn to delegate and oversee responsibilities of the group, rather than micromanaging them.  Please let me know if this is going to create any additional problems, or if I need to take a different approach.  \n",

      "Body: \n",
      "Dear  Michelle:\n",
      " \n",
      "     On Tuesday, October 23, I met with Christina Solomon, counsel for Doug  Miller.  The elusive Liz Miller failed to attend, having been called at the  last minute into an all-day meeting.  We have tentatively agreed that we  will meet next week.\n",
      " \n",
      "     Despite Liz Miller's absence, I believe that the meeting was productive.  I  learned the following information:\n",
      " \n",
      "     1.    Doug Miller claims that there are three power grids that  are unrelated, that he worked only in the East for ENA and works only in Texas  for Calpine.  Thus, he claims that his duties and activities do not overlap  in any way with those he performed for ENA.\n",
      " \n",
      "     2.    Calpine did not know of Miller's non-compete at the time  Miller was hired because he believed it had expired.  He brought it to  Calpine's attention immediately upon being contacted by ENA.\n",
      " \n",
      "     3.    Christina argued, as she did in the answer and  counterclaim, that the non-compete agreement was fatally overbroad, as Miller  never had any duties involving the majority of the activities from which the  non-compete purports to bar him. \n",
      " \n",
      "     In response, I told her the following:\n",
      "     \n",
      "     1.    We do not accept Miller's assertion that simply working in  another region will sufficiently insulate our trade secrets, since strategies  may not be confined to a single region.\n",
      " \n",
      "     2.    I pointed out to her that Miller's contract very clearly  states that the non-compete extends three months after employment even if the  contract term has expired.  I also pointed out that he was reminded of his  non-compete orally several times by ENA personnel upon his  resignation.\n",
      " \n",
      "     3.    I explained that the non-compete had been enforced on many  occasions and that it was carefully crafted with an eye to protecting the many  trade secrets to which Miller may have had access.

The determination of exactly which plans must go to the committee will be made by Mary Joyce upon receipt of a bullet point presentation of the key terms of the plan.  The committee would likely review any compensation plan pursuant to which (i) employees receive equity interests without making capital contributions in cash or other property with reasonably equivalent value to the equity interests, (ii) employees receive equity interests prior to Enron recovering its investment, or (iii) employees are to be offered employment agreements with terms that are not within \"Enron norms.\"  In addition, all significant terms of the compensation plan are to be disclosed in the DASH.\n",

      "Dear  Michelle:\n",
      " \n",
      "    I  just finished my conference call with Liz Miller (counsel for Calpine),  Christina Solomon, and Steve Schuler (Steve is co-counsel for Miller with  Christina).  Christina had passed along to Liz the various points I made at  the meeting last week, so Liz was prepared to address our primary  concerns.  She made the following points:\n",
      "         \n",
      "         (1)    She has talked with several different people at various  levels of authority in Calpine's trading area, and insists that Calpine treats  the power grids as \"completely different\" regions, strategies for which are not  shared internally among those regions.    \n",
      " \n",
      "         (2)    She asserts that \"how we do it at Calpine is totally  different from Enron,\" since Calpine is \"trading around a portfolio of assets  that we own.\"  She asserted that Enron, not owning power generation assets,  trades differently.  When I replied that Enron does have power generation  assets, she acknowledged the fact but insisted that Enron's trading style is  vastly different due to the difference in emphasis vis a vis the power  generation assets.\n",
      " \n",
      "         (3)    Liz claims that Miller works almost exclusively in  \"Urcot\" (sp??) in Texas, with some participation in Entergy in Louisiana.   According to Liz, Calpine's strategies concerning these specific regions is  divorced from and not related in any way with any trading Calpine does in the  East or West.  \n",
      " \n",
      "         (4)    Liz is of the opinion that Miller \"is not senior enough  that we would be looking for what he knows.\"  He has no role whatsoever in  discussing or formulating strategy for trading.  Miller, she insists, is on  the receiving end only.  He takes orders, dispatching and scheduling  solely in response to orders he receives from others.\n",
      " \n",
      "         (5)    Liz acknowledges that, were Miller in a more senior,  responsible position, she would have the same concerns we are expressing were  the tables turned.  Miller is \"so slotted,\" however, that she believes that  he is not in a position to use any Enron trade secret that he might possess  (though she and Miller's attorneys expressed doubt that he could retain any  critical information, that the most critical information changes on a day-to-day  basis).\n",
      " \n",
      "       We  ended the conversation with the following  understandings:\n",
      " \n",
      "        (1)    Liz  will explore whether Calpine could put Miller in a non-trading function for a  period of two months or so.  \n",
      " \n",
      "                 --She hastened to add, however, that trading is the only area for which  they really have any use for Miller.  She then suggested that she could  explore putting him instead in the West (\"I know Enron doesn't even have a  western desk here.\").  I believe that any proposal she comes back  with will entail his continuing in some trading  function.\n",
      " \n",
      "        (2)    Liz  will try to determine how Calpine might provide assurances (acceptable to  ENA) that Miller is \"on the receiving end only,\" as she asserts, such that we  would be confident that he is indeed not in a position to use any trade  secrets he may remember.\n",
      "   \n",
      "                 --On this point, I was clear that I did not know either what level of assurance  ENA would require or whether this would even be a feasible  alternative.\n",
      "     \n",
      "         (3)    I am to explore with ENA whether this additional  information about Calpine's difference in trading strategy and the limitations  on Miller's duties alleviates ENA's concerns about protection of its trade  secrets.\n",
      " \n",
      "                 --Liz seems to believe that if the business people really knew the information  she is giving to me, they would not be concerned about the activities of this  low level person.\n",
      " \n",
      "     Liz has asked that we reconnect later this week to exchange answers to  these inquiries.  I look forward to discussing with you our  response.\n",
      " \n",
      "     Thanks for your assistance.\n",
      " \n",
      "Best  regards,\n",

      "Body: Would you mind checking into something for me?  One of our lawyers was called by someone from Industrial Markets who was laid off.  He indicated that he had an employment contract that has a six month non-compete for involuntary termination.  He said that he called HR to get a waiver of the non-compete so that he could pursue new employment and was told that no waiver would be granted.  Is that our policy or are these issues being addressed on a case by case basis?  I find it hard to believe that we would even think about enforcing a non-compete for someone we've laid off, so why not grant the waiver?

He asked if this group was selected as a group or if this was an amalgamation of HR employees from the various operating companies.

      " \n",
      "This is an incorrect interpretation because Clause 4(b)(i) states that the the payment is due upon the EARLIER of the PPA signature date OR the Project PAYMENT date. If you then look at the definition of \"SP/RJ Project Payment Date\" on page 7 it tells you that it is the FIRST to occur of \"Financial Closing\" or \"COMMENCEMENT OF CONSTRUCTION\". And, finally, if you go to the definition of \"Commencement of Construction\" on page 4 it tells you that it occurs when at least 10% of the payments to contractors have been made. This payment in other words is due many months ago as the project is now 100% complete.\n",

I think the best way is for me and my accountants to be provided with the name of an Enron accountant who has the data and authority to discuss them with us so that we can address any issues.\n",

      "To:     Notestine, Kerry \n",
      "Subject:        ENA agreement- review for compliance with Mississippi law \n",
      "Generally, the agreement is compliant with Mississippi law.  It is not hard to comply with Mississippi law when it comes to employment agreements.  Mississippi is pretty much the opposite of California in regard to employee rights.  Mississippi does not have many restrictions.  Plaintiffs' employment attorneys would probably starve in Mississippi if it weren't for federal laws.\n",
      "Mississippi allows non-competes and protection of trade secrets and confidential business information.  It has a pretty broad view of what is included in that category, so I think the agreement is ok in that regard.  Specifically, the case law says that a covenant not to compete may be enforced if \"necessary for the protection of [the employer's] business and goodwill.\"  See Texas Rd. Boring Co. of La.-Miss. v. Parker, 194 So.2d 885 (Miss. 1967).  The validity and enforceability of a non-compete is predicated upon the reasonableness and specificity of its terms, primarily, the duration of the restriction and its geographic scope.  See Redd Pest Control Co. v. Heatherly, 248 Miss. 34, 157 So.2d 133 (1963).  To be enforceable, the covenant must strike a balance between the interests of the employer and the employee, and its enforcement must not pose a threat to the public of monopoly or unfair competition.  See Empiregas, Inc. of Kosciusko v. Bain, 599 So.2d 971, 975 (Miss. 1992).  \n",
      "Incidentally, even if the court found the terms and categories of a non-compete to be too broadly defined, that would not be a problem because Mississippi courts can blue pencil those types of things to make non-competes enforceable.  The time and geographic restriction in this agreement would most likely be found to be reasonable under Mississippi law, as other courts have upheld similar restrictions.  The only concern I have in that regard is that the agreement says it will be enforceable even against an employee who is termed without cause, and Mississippi law holds that Court's should not enforce non-competes if the employee was terminated in an arbitrary or capricious manner or in bad faith.  However, I don't think that means we need to change the language in the contract, I just think you need to advise the client of that fact so it cannot expect to be able to terminate an employee in bad faith and still enforce the non-compete.   \n",
      "Mississippi allows for employment agreements to be arbitrated.  Thus, the arbitration provision is fine.  The only thing I might add is a clause which says, \"The arbitrator selected may not have any interest in the subject matter in dispute, nor can he be related by consanguinity or affinity to the parties entering into this agreement\" because that is a requirement under Mississippi law.\n",
      "Incidentally, my only other concern is that the agreement says it will be governed by Texas law.  Choice of law is an unsettled area in Mississippi when it comes to employment agreements/non-competes in Mississippi, so there is no reason why the client cannot insist on such a provision.  However, the client should probably be advised that such an area of law is always subject to change and it might be enforced by a Mississippi court regardless of what the agreement says.\n",

      "I'd like to bring your attention to a complaint I have with your company's overall experience. I know you appreciate your customers and want to keep them happy, so I am certain you'll want to address this quickly. This incident has infuriated me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's the problem: How DARE you treat your former employees the way you have in the last three weeks!!!  To throw employees who have devoted their lives to make your company great out on the street with no severance and trying to get out of the WARN act is a disgrace.\n",
      "\n",
      "We were told to wait out the bankrupty, and you would be petitioning the court for a severence in addition to the measly $4500 we received.  It's been like pulling teeth to get information about our termination date, unemployment, insurance, and all of our unanswered questions.  And to top it all off, you gave YOURSELVES $58 million dollars in BONUSES!  Meanwhile, there are former employees out there that have lost their entire retirement, kids who aren't getting a Christmas this year, and families having to sell their homes.  How do you sleep at night?!?!?!\n",
      "\n",
      "My situation isn't as bad as some, but I got screwed nonetheless.  With only a year of experience, all at Enron, I'm having an EXTREMELY hard time competing with the talented Enron exes.  I have a wedding in six months, student loans, a car note, credit card debt, and I was FOUR DAYS AWAY from closing on a new house that I can't get anymore because I don't have a job.  Frivilous, maybe, but I don't know what I'm supposed to do now with no benefits and desperately trying to fight depression, which doesn't make this any easier.\n",
      "\n",
      "I hope the bankruptcy court\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's what I'd like to see happen: Just pay all the employees you've laid off since November the severance you kept telling us we would get.  That and any outstanding monies that the $4500 didn't cover (this includes payment for our unused vacation time!!!).\n",
      "\n",
      "We will NOT let you get away with this.\n",
      "\n",
      "My overall experiences with your company have been extremely negative. This incident has discouraged me. I definitely won't recommend you to any of my family or friends.\n",

      "I suggest we talk first. Call me on the following cell phone 713-962-1490. The difficulty I suspect is that people are understandably uncertain of the unknown, but in 10 days we will have everything nailed down. Additionally, people, it would appear, seem to be making certain assumptions about the estate which I believe are false. I can't see the estate continuing to sponsor green cards, or in maintaining the cash balance plan, at least in the form of the past, etc., etc., Bankruptcy isn't pleasant.\n",
      " \n",
      "I would however, like to avoid selling NETCO at the estate's expense, as difficult as this may be.\n",
      " \n",
      "The main points we need to communicate and build around would be;\n",
      " \n",
      "Salary - Everyone we talked to has indicated a willingness to keep them at least at current levels\n",
      "Job responsibility - This is entirely Jay and Jenny's call. If they see a person as necessary to do a different job, they need to explain that. Typically, people should be transferring in exactly the same position as the current have, that would be the whole point of why NETCO needs them. Clearly NETCO will be a subsidiary of a large bank and as such will not have quite the same prominence it enjoyed with Enron pre-bankruptcy. Unfortunately, that is lost forever.\n",
      "Bonus - Plan two main counter parties have agreed is more generous than Enron's current arrangement, if we perform.\n",
      "Retention - Two main counter parties have agreed in principle to a pool of cash to be paid to the 700 people in NETCO who didn't get anything in Nov. This would be paid as soon as practical after signing in exchange for a commitment for them to stay for 3 months or so otherwise they will have to repay it.\n",
      "Benefits - These will differ depending on who buys us. However, it each case they have comparable benefits but they are obviously different. On the specific point of pension plan, they have plans that require some vesting period but again the 2 main counter parties have agreed that they will take Enron service into account (i.e. if they have 5 years with Enron and their plan requires 5 years service to vest they will vest immediately, but obviously will get just their first years contribution). Now is someone is 4 years in with Enron, I recognise this is not a great answer, but has to be contrasted with how long there is a position in the estate for them (i.e. is there a job for another 12 months). The last point concentrates too much on negative aspects of what may happen to estate, so I would prefer to avoid too much innuendo here.\n",
      "VISA's - we have a plan to switch all H1b visa's within 24 hours. This is apparently straight forward and Neil and Tim Callahan and I have discussed logistics with one of the counter-parties in some detail. On L1's, these will take up to 3 weeks to switch to H1's. Of the 70 people identified who have VISA's only about 7 or 8 have L1's. Tindall and Foster tell us this will not pose a problem and again we have discussed this with the one of the counter-parties who have agreed our approach. These people should avoid traveling outside US in this 3 weeks, but according to Tindall and Foster will be legit.\n",
      "Green Cards - No easy solution. Essentially these will have to start from scratch. The counter parties have not at this stage told us whether they will support new applications. However, bear in mind I do not believe the Enron estate will continue with green cards, although this has not been officially proclaimed.\n",
      "Expat Terms - These will probably be honored by the new company, although each counter-party has indicated a desire to \"normalise\" the terms with those of their own company, over time.\n",
      "Employment Agreements - We have identified 179 across NETCO. The estate plans to transfer these to the buyer, but it is clear that each prospective buyer does not readily accept this as a term of the deal. As such my working assumption is that the offer letters each NETCO ee receives circa Jan 12, will supercede all previous terms including employment agreements, that individuals may have had. Specifically, I expect that the new employer will not honor future equity, cash retention, target bonus or severance provisions that may be in people contracts. Clearly, there may be some negotiation here.\n",
      " \n",
      "Now, we have other things like Title's, PRC, Promotion dates, Salary reviews, project bonuses, All employee stock option programs, etc., to figure out, but I think it unlikely that these will be unpleasant surprises, after all the new employer will be probably one of the 5 biggest investments banks in the world and we almost certainly benchmarked our processes on them over the last 10 years. There may even be an ability to transfer (after a while to a different part of their organisation, if they have an internal posting process).\n",
      " \n",
      "As to process from here, we want to identify those who DON\"T want to go and why. I want to avoid ANYONE receiving an \"offer\" to switch and NOT accepting it. As I mention above, many of the terms of the \"offer\" are unlikely to be a huge surprise, and if people have genuine concerns I want to switch them out now for someone who does want to go. We should have 100% acceptance, not because of bullying or ultimatum's but because we figure out early who had concerns, solving them or switching them out for someone else.\n",

      "I talked with Jay on Friday because I was concerned that Steve Stock and Zhiyong Wei, two senior IT guys, had concerns about Netco and were asking me why it wouldn't be better to stay on the Estate. My whole purpose in discussing this with Jay was to make sure he was aware of their feelings. However, it seems that some of  this miscommunication was and has become an exagerration.\n",
      " \n",
      "I attended Beth Perlman's floor meeting when she communciated the difference between the Estate and Netco. She said that Jay Webb would be talking with everyone that had been identified to go to Netco and that she would be talking with individuals that would be staying on with the Estate. She did tell the employees that if they were identified to go to Netco and had a problem with this then they should talk with her and HR. She also said upon deal closure if the Netco employees receive offers and they turn them down it would be a voluntary resignation.  She urged them to please talk with us now if there are any concerns. She also said that we have requested to offer same salaries, to bridge service, and to pay retention bonuses at the time of deal closure. In addition, she communicated that we have limited information but we would update the group when more became available. \n",
      " \n",
      "It was never communicated that if they went to Netco they would lose their visas, etc. I have received a lot of questions and concerns about visas but my response is that we are working on this and we have it covered. I have also heard a lot of concerns on the Cash Balance Plan and my response is that we have asked to bridge employees service but we will not know until deal closure.  I have stressed that Netco wants to keep intellectual capital and will most likely make a fair offer to keep employees whole. \n",
      " \n",
      "In talking with employees identified to go to Netco their biggest concerns are 1) they are not guranteed same benefits, salary, bonus, etc and they feel like they will be bullied into accepting the Netco offer and 2)they are on visas and in the green card process and don't want to start the process over because they don't have enough time left on their visa. I have talked to Neil Davies about the second concern and we are trying to come up with some options. I have talked with the concerned employees about what we requested but I am not sure how else to alleviate their concerns. \n",

If it's getting \"offered a lower paid job\" that simply isn't in the plans of the NETCO transaction, unless Beth, Jay and Jenny are wanting to do that before the transaction (can't think why they would). Bottom-line, people will transfer to a SOLVENT, Aplus credit rated company, on the same salary on perform whatever job Jay and Jenny ask them to. The benefits will switch, but we already know that counter parties benefits are fairly generous even by our standards, and they will agree to bridge service for vesting in pension et al. Bonus plan should be very good (current proposals are slightly better than Enron's). Titles, promotions, stock awards and base pay raises we aren't sure about just yet, but my working assumption is they will follow Enron previous practice until agreed otherwise.\n",

The insurance company may not pay the benefit regardless of what Enron wants to do.  If when the insurance company understands the circumstances, would be willing to pay a benefit to an employee on WARN leave of absence, then it would be a good idea to have the Welfare Benefits Plans Committee adopt a procedure for such insured plans that states employees on WARN leave of absence or furlough with pay are considered to be actively at work during such period that they are instructed not to come to their work location during such time. \n",

The reason why I've chosen these categories are that they are the accepted categorisations by the Commission for Racial Equality, who are the governing body on race relations in the UK, and are aligned to their counter-parts in Europe.  If we do have a legal challenge, we will be asked to provide data in this fomat, rather than the US descriptors which are not as relevant to the European ethnic profile (for instance 'Hispanic' is not a meaningful category for Europe, whereas it is very significant for the US).  I'd prefer to map the US definitions onto the European ones, but to collect the European data in the CRE's format.\"  ...\n",

      "I left a message with Twanda for you to give me a call.  Lately I have been asked to review letter agreements between EWS and Arthur Anderson LLP for services to be provided by AA.  These services generally relate to having AA personnel work on EWS projects on Enron property (in our offices).  I have asked GSS if we have any global agreement that would cover this, but have been advised that the only AA agreement we have is an old one that has probably been rolled in to the Accenture LLP group - which is an offshoot AA and, as I understand it, not affiliated with AA any longer.\n",

(from ENW/CORP etc) and at the same time do letters confirming assignment of EEA's for those on EEA's with Corp/ENW etc who have an assignment clause. Also suggest we ask those who do not have the assignment term in their agreement to sign an amendment to their agreement assigning the contract to ENA.\n",

      "2) Also as we are likely to apply for new H1 visas for all L1 visas - I would think it makes sense for new visa's this to be with ENA - as I assume this is the most likely company to be part of the acquisition ? Therefore we will need to do transfer letters for those employees who are not ENA employees as part of this exercise. Tyndall and Forster will probably require an upfront payment to apply for these visa's - @ $3,500 + $1000 for the premium processing. Therefore we will need to cut a cheque to them for (18 L1 transfers) of circa $ 80,000 - we may be able to negotiate  this down some.\n",

      "Body: \n",
      "Dear  Michelle:\n",
      " \n",
      "    I  just finished my conference call with Liz Miller (counsel for Calpine),  Christina Solomon, and Steve Schuler (Steve is co-counsel for Miller with  Christina).  Christina had passed along to Liz the various points I made at  the meeting last week, so Liz was prepared to address our primary  concerns.  She made the following points:\n",
      "         \n",
      "         (1)    She has talked with several different people at various  levels of authority in Calpine's trading area, and insists that Calpine treats  the power grids as \"completely different\" regions, strategies for which are not  shared internally among those regions.    \n",
      " \n",
      "         (2)    She asserts that \"how we do it at Calpine is totally  different from Enron,\" since Calpine is \"trading around a portfolio of assets  that we own.\"  She asserted that Enron, not owning power generation assets,  trades differently.  When I replied that Enron does have power generation  assets, she acknowledged the fact but insisted that Enron's trading style is  vastly different due to the difference in emphasis vis a vis the power  generation assets.\n",
      " \n",
      "         (3)    Liz claims that Miller works almost exclusively in  \"Urcot\" (sp??) in Texas, with some participation in Entergy in Louisiana.   According to Liz, Calpine's strategies concerning these specific regions is  divorced from and not related in any way with any trading Calpine does in the  East or West.  \n",
      " \n",
      "         (4)    Liz is of the opinion that Miller \"is not senior enough  that we would be looking for what he knows.\"  He has no role whatsoever in  discussing or formulating strategy for trading.  Miller, she insists, is on  the receiving end only.  He takes orders, dispatching and scheduling  solely in response to orders he receives from others.\n",
      " \n",
      "         (5)    Liz acknowledges that, were Miller in a more senior,  responsible position, she would have the same concerns we are expressing were  the tables turned.  Miller is \"so slotted,\" however, that she believes that  he is not in a position to use any Enron trade secret that he might possess  (though she and Miller's attorneys expressed doubt that he could retain any  critical information, that the most critical information changes on a day-to-day  basis).\n",
      " \n",
      "       We  ended the conversation with the following  understandings:\n",
      " \n",
      "        (1)    Liz  will explore whether Calpine could put Miller in a non-trading function for a  period of two months or so.  \n",
      " \n",
      "                 --She hastened to add, however, that trading is the only area for which  they really have any use for Miller.  She then suggested that she could  explore putting him instead in the West (\"I know Enron doesn't even have a  western desk here.\").  I believe that any proposal she comes back  with will entail his continuing in some trading  function.\n",
      " \n",
      "        (2)    Liz  will try to determine how Calpine might provide assurances (acceptable to  ENA) that Miller is \"on the receiving end only,\" as she asserts, such that we  would be confident that he is indeed not in a position to use any trade  secrets he may remember.\n",
      "   \n",
      "                 --On this point, I was clear that I did not know either what level of assurance  ENA would require or whether this would even be a feasible  alternative.\n",
      "     \n",
      "         (3)    I am to explore with ENA whether this additional  information about Calpine's difference in trading strategy and the limitations  on Miller's duties alleviates ENA's concerns about protection of its trade  secrets.\n",
      " \n",
      "                 --Liz seems to believe that if the business people really knew the information  she is giving to me, they would not be concerned about the activities of this  low level person.\n",
      " \n",
      "     Liz has asked that we reconnect later this week to exchange answers to  these inquiries.  I look forward to discussing with you our  response.\n",
      " \n",
      "     Thanks for your assistance.\n",

      "Body: \n",
      "The proposed discipline below is designed to provide guidelines for HR generalists in addressing violations of the \"Internet Security Policy for the use of Electronic Media and Services\" to ensure consistency in the application of disciplinary measures.  In general, the discipline should follow the corrective action policy that has been established for addressing unacceptable conduct (see policy #11, corrective discipline). The recommendations below are designed to address situations where employees transmit externally electronic communication that is \"discriminatory, harassing, threatening, derogatory, obscene, defamatory, a \"chain letter\" or junk mail, untrue, fraudulent, illegal, against Company policy, contrary to the Company's interest or for personal profit\" (as outlined in Enron's Code of Ethics).\n",
      "\n",
      "First Offense:  Automated electronic warning that the system has detected an inappropriate electronic mail being sent from the employee's mail box and that another violation will result in the HR Representative and Supervisor being notified and possible disciplinary action.  Also warning message refers employee to Internet Security Policy. \n",
      "\n",
      "Second Offense:  Second automated electronic warning to employee with copy to HR Rep and Supervisor.  HR Rep and Supervisor to verbally warn employee to ensure understanding of Company policy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third Offense:  Third automated electronic warning to employee with a copy to Supervisor and HR.  HR Rep and Supervisor to give Written warning to employee to be placed in PH file.  Written warning to state that further violation may result in termination. \n",
      "\n",
      "Fourth Offense:  System notice of shut down for continuing violation.  Copy of notice sent to HR Rep and Supervisor.  HR Rep and Supervisor to consult with Legal depart prior to employee termination for misconduct.\n",
      "\n",
      "Using these guidelines, it is suggested that the  HR Rep and Management consider the specifics of the offense and determine the appropriate corrective action. \n",
      "\n",
      "Other Issues/Considerations:\n",
      "Should we carve out transmissions that are \"untrue, fraudulent, illegal, against Company policy, contrary to the Company's interest and for personal profit\" and have a more severe discipline for those situations?\n",
      "Should same discipline be used when employees access inappropriate or pornographic sites.\n",
      "Should we attempt to define all terms?\n",
      "Is it appropriate to use a \"one size fit's all\" approach.  Should the discipline for transmitting motivational messages be the same as discipline for a threatening, obscene, derogatory, etc. message?\n",
      "How should we address inappropriate electronic messages transmitted internally?\n",
      "\n",
      "Please route your comments to me or be prepared to discuss at our next meeting to be held Monday, July 23rd from 10:30 am to 11:30 am in EB 3824.\n",

The online site contains the documentation required to meet our regulatory obligations including the AAP narrative, goals and utilization analysis.  We have also included links to critical EEO/AA policies and related information.   We are excited about this opportunity to simplify your access to this critical and important information.   Please reference this web-site when you have an open position that needs to be filled or when considering transferring and promoting employees.   The URL link is listed at the bottom of this message.\n",
      "\n",
      "Through our Affirmative Action Programs we take positive steps to ensure that we deliver on our commitment to EEO.  Affirmative Action is not about quotas for women or minorities nor is it about preferential treatment to less qualified candidates because of their race, gender, disability or veteran status.  Through affirmative action, we seek to establish a \"level playing field\" for all employees and applicants, regardless of race, gender, disability or veteran status.  We use statistical analyses of employment patterns as indicators of whether the playing field is truly level.\n",
      "\n",
      "The AAP contains proprietary information, therefore it should not be shared with anyone outside of Enron.  If your operating company is participating in a bidding process where EEO/AAP information is requested, please forward those requests to the corporate Office of Labor & Employee Relations at EB1561 or call (713) 853-3086.  Please refer to Enron's Code of Ethics book for guidance concerning your obligations of confidence with proprietary company information.\n",

      "Although the AAP contains proprietary information and belongs to Enron Corp., the narrative section is to be made available for review during regular work hours to all job applicants and employees who ask to see it.  We ask that these requests be forwarded through Human Resources and that the web site you are accessing not be shared.\n",
      "\n",
      "We would also like to take this opportunity to reaffirm the strong commitment of Enron Corp. to the principle of Equal Employment Opportunity in its personnel policies and practices.  It is our Company policy to recruit, hire, train, and promote into all job levels, the most qualified employees and applicants for employment, without regard to race, color, religion, age, sex, national origin, disability, or veteran status.  All employee selections are based on (1) inclusive recruitment and outreach efforts, and the merit, qualifications and competence of individuals for the particular positions, and (2) consistently providing equal employment opportunity.  We believe that a diverse workforce is a strength, and that as we implement personnel policies and practices which foster fair treatment on the basis of race, sex and disability, we promote equitable employment opportunities for all employees and applicants.\n",

      "Enron administers all personnel programs and employment opportunities without regard to race, color, religion, age, sex, pregnancy, national origin, physical or mental disability, veteran status, or status as an alien authorized to work in the United States.  Such employment programs and opportunities include, but are not limited to, compensation, benefits, transfers, layoff, leaves of absence, return from layoff, training, education, tuition assistance, and Company-sponsored social and recreational programs.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have developed and implemented the 2001 Affirmative Action Program (AAP) to support our commitment to the principle of equal employment opportunity and meet federal and state requirements.  The AAP describes, in detail, the policies and procedures used in the Company's operations to carry out its commitment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your company's EEO Officer, as stipulated in your plan narrative, is responsible for administering the Company's Affirmative Action Program and will report to senior management on a continuing basis with regard to the progress being made under the AAP.

      "Body: I suggest we talk first. Call me on the following cell phone 713-962-1490. The difficulty I suspect is that people are understandably uncertain of the unknown, but in 10 days we will have everything nailed down. Additionally, people, it would appear, seem to be making certain assumptions about the estate which I believe are false. I can't see the estate continuing to sponsor green cards, or in maintaining the cash balance plan, at least in the form of the past, etc., etc., Bankruptcy isn't pleasant.\n",
      " \n",
      "I would however, like to avoid selling NETCO at the estate's expense, as difficult as this may be.\n",
      " \n",
      "The main points we need to communicate and build around would be;\n",
      " \n",
      "Salary - Everyone we talked to has indicated a willingness to keep them at least at current levels\n",
      "Job responsibility - This is entirely Jay and Jenny's call. If they see a person as necessary to do a different job, they need to explain that. Typically, people should be transferring in exactly the same position as the current have, that would be the whole point of why NETCO needs them. Clearly NETCO will be a subsidiary of a large bank and as such will not have quite the same prominence it enjoyed with Enron pre-bankruptcy. Unfortunately, that is lost forever.\n",
      "Bonus - Plan two main counter parties have agreed is more generous than Enron's current arrangement, if we perform.\n",
      "Retention - Two main counter parties have agreed in principle to a pool of cash to be paid to the 700 people in NETCO who didn't get anything in Nov. This would be paid as soon as practical after signing in exchange for a commitment for them to stay for 3 months or so otherwise they will have to repay it.\n",
      "Benefits - These will differ depending on who buys us. However, it each case they have comparable benefits but they are obviously different. On the specific point of pension plan, they have plans that require some vesting period but again the 2 main counter parties have agreed that they will take Enron service into account (i.e. if they have 5 years with Enron and their plan requires 5 years service to vest they will vest immediately, but obviously will get just their first years contribution). Now is someone is 4 years in with Enron, I recognise this is not a great answer, but has to be contrasted with how long there is a position in the estate for them (i.e. is there a job for another 12 months). The last point concentrates too much on negative aspects of what may happen to estate, so I would prefer to avoid too much innuendo here.\n",
      "VISA's - we have a plan to switch all H1b visa's within 24 hours. This is apparently straight forward and Neil and Tim Callahan and I have discussed logistics with one of the counter-parties in some detail. On L1's, these will take up to 3 weeks to switch to H1's. Of the 70 people identified who have VISA's only about 7 or 8 have L1's. Tindall and Foster tell us this will not pose a problem and again we have discussed this with the one of the counter-parties who have agreed our approach. These people should avoid traveling outside US in this 3 weeks, but according to Tindall and Foster will be legit.\n",
      "Green Cards - No easy solution. Essentially these will have to start from scratch. The counter parties have not at this stage told us whether they will support new applications. However, bear in mind I do not believe the Enron estate will continue with green cards, although this has not been officially proclaimed.\n",
      "Expat Terms - These will probably be honored by the new company, although each counter-party has indicated a desire to \"normalise\" the terms with those of their own company, over time.\n",
      "Employment Agreements - We have identified 179 across NETCO. The estate plans to transfer these to the buyer, but it is clear that each prospective buyer does not readily accept this as a term of the deal. As such my working assumption is that the offer letters each NETCO ee receives circa Jan 12, will supercede all previous terms including employment agreements, that individuals may have had. Specifically, I expect that the new employer will not honor future equity, cash retention, target bonus or severance provisions that may be in people contracts. Clearly, there may be some negotiation here.\n",
      " \n",
      "Now, we have other things like Title's, PRC, Promotion dates, Salary reviews, project bonuses, All employee stock option programs, etc., to figure out, but I think it unlikely that these will be unpleasant surprises, after all the new employer will be probably one of the 5 biggest investments banks in the world and we almost certainly benchmarked our processes on them over the last 10 years. There may even be an ability to transfer (after a while to a different part of their organisation, if they have an internal posting process).\n",
      " \n",
      "As to process from here, we want to identify those who DON\"T want to go and why. I want to avoid ANYONE receiving an \"offer\" to switch and NOT accepting it. As I mention above, many of the terms of the \"offer\" are unlikely to be a huge surprise, and if people have genuine concerns I want to switch them out now for someone who does want to go. We should have 100% acceptance, not because of bullying or ultimatum's but because we figure out early who had concerns, solving them or switching them out for someone else.\n",

My whole purpose in discussing this with Jay was to make sure he was aware of their feelings. However, it seems that some of  this miscommunication was and has become an exagerration.\n",
      " \n",
      "I attended Beth Perlman's floor meeting when she communciated the difference between the Estate and Netco. She said that Jay Webb would be talking with everyone that had been identified to go to Netco and that she would be talking with individuals that would be staying on with the Estate. She did tell the employees that if they were identified to go to Netco and had a problem with this then they should talk with her and HR. She also said upon deal closure if the Netco employees receive offers and they turn them down it would be a voluntary resignation.  She urged them to please talk with us now if there are any concerns. She also said that we have requested to offer same salaries, to bridge service, and to pay retention bonuses at the time of deal closure. In addition, she communicated that we have limited information but we would update the group when more became available. \n",
      " \n",
      "It was never communicated that if they went to Netco they would lose their visas, etc. I have received a lot of questions and concerns about visas but my response is that we are working on this and we have it covered. I have also heard a lot of concerns on the Cash Balance Plan and my response is that we have asked to bridge employees service but we will not know until deal closure.  I have stressed that Netco wants to keep intellectual capital and will most likely make a fair offer to keep employees whole. \n",
      " \n",
      "In talking with employees identified to go to Netco their biggest concerns are 1) they are not guranteed same benefits, salary, bonus, etc and they feel like they will be bullied into accepting the Netco offer and 2)they are on visas and in the green card process and don't want to start the process over because they don't have enough time left on their visa. I have talked to Neil Davies about the second concern and we are trying to come up with some options. I have talked with the concerned employees about what we requested but I am not sure how else to alleviate their concerns. \n",

If it's getting \"offered a lower paid job\" that simply isn't in the plans of the NETCO transaction, unless Beth, Jay and Jenny are wanting to do that before the transaction (can't think why they would). Bottom-line, people will transfer to a SOLVENT, Aplus credit rated company, on the same salary on perform whatever job Jay and Jenny ask them to. The benefits will switch, but we already know that counter parties benefits are fairly generous even by our standards, and they will agree to bridge service for vesting in pension et al. Bonus plan should be very good (current proposals are slightly better than Enron's). Titles, promotions, stock awards and base pay raises we aren't sure about just yet, but my working assumption is they will follow Enron previous practice until agreed otherwise.\n",

If we are going to have a heading called \"compliance,\" then I believe that we should add bullets on updating, publicizing, and striving for AAP targets, audits of compensation at all levels (which is where the OFCCP audit came from), audits of other employment practices (e.g., staffing, PRC, promotions, layoffs, etc.), risk management processes in termination of employment, and other related items.  This should be a combination of compliance, government relations, and legal.  Perhaps we call is HR Risk Mitigation/management instead???

      "\tI have long thought that the PRC Process needs to be changed in order to better provide the appropriate feedback and motivation as well as rewards that a good review process should.  I hope you will consider my thoughts carefully since I have had active involvement in the process from its inception and believe that I can offer some advice that should be considered.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\tIt appears that the results of the process have become too demoralizing to the employee being reviewed.  Even those that do well are suspicious of the process and don't particularly like it.  It causes a great deal of stress on employees and creates an atmosphere of cynicism among the people that should be supportive of it.  There is a belief that the process is arbitrary and that no one gets a fair hearing based on their performance but rather the results are skewed by the negotiating skills and argumentative success of any particular reviewer.  The biggest single complaint seems to be the fact that an employee can be told after one review period that they are excellent and six months later be told they are only satisfactory or worse.  While the employee's performance may have suffered during that period of time, the message that they hear is not necessarily that their performance has declined but rather that they as an individual are not valued and are not as good as they were six months earlier.  We are mixing the message between the worth of the individual and the results of their performance.  The following is my recommendation to improve on this system:\n",
      "\n",
      "\tSEPARATE THE PERFORMANCE CATEGORIES INTO THREE MAJOR CATEGORIES   \n",
      "\n",
      "\t\n",
      "\t1.  Employee Skill, Competency and Character  - This category measures a persons inherent skill, talent, intelligence and commitments to Enron's values.  This determinant should not change drastically between each review period since it measures whats inside a person and that should only change slowly or with the development of new skills or the hiring of new and better qualified employees.  In this category a person could be told whether they are excellent or superior or average and know that they have an opportunity to improve on that ranking through their own effort while also realizing that we are continually trying to raise the bar with new hires.  This particular performance measurement is also a measure of the success of our hiring and training program.\n",
      "\n",
      "\t2.  Employee Performance - This a measure of how well an employee is performing the tasks of any particular job.  This measure could fluctuate much more than the first since each person's performance can vary greatly over time based on many different circumstances.  This measure would also distinguish those employees who may not be considered to have the best skills or greatest intelligence but who through sheer hard work and determination are outstanding performers.  It should also help identify those who are under performing and not living up to their potential as measured by the first category.  This category also measures our skill as managers and leaders of people since it is often the managers job to motivate people to perform above and beyond their own capability.\n",
      "\n",
      "\t3.  Results - This is a measure of the financial performance and result of the effort of any individual employee.  I believe this criteria is most suited to the commercial employees and should be the major determining factor (but not the only on) in annual bonus payments.  This should be closely correlated to the Job Performance criteria but it may not always be since some people may be working on a long term project which has a payback at some future date or in the other extreme someone could have lucked out by being in the right place at the right time and gaining the benefit from it without the appropriate effort.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tIn addition to these three categories I would also reduce the Job Descriptions that are included in the PRC process.  I think it is a waste of time to include clerks,  assistants, accounting personnel and other non manager commercial support people in the process.  Very little is gained by them or by management and a tremendous amount of stress and ill will is created.  I would also reduce the amount of time spent on the PRC at mid year and only focus on the first two performance categories at that time.  I would also change the time when the PRC review is done since now it happens in the summer when many people are trying to scheduled vacations and at year end when there is so much other business activity going on.  I think a March, September schedule would work much better.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tThere are probably many other ideas to improve the PRC process and I am sure that you are working on them.  Please give my ideas some thought and see if they don't merit some consideration.  ...\n",

      "Dear Sarah\n",
      "\n",
      "Further to our correspondence earlier this week, you asked me to look at the documentation that you sent me from a data privacy perspective.  As requested, I set out below what I believe are the significant issues in relation to the relevant documents. \n",
      "\n",
      "Preface to policy\n",
      "\n",
      "*     In relation to the \"Prefatory Statement To Employee Data Protection Policy\" I note that this prefatory statement and the associated policy relate only to employee data and it is therefore unclear what steps Enron is taking in respect of other data.\n",
      "\n",
      "*     The last paragraph on the first page of the prefatory statement states that \"we are implementing the Employee Data Protection Policy attached to this Preface in an effort to assure employees and the appropriate regulatory agencies that we have in place data protections that are comparable to those mandated by the Directive and other similar data protection laws\".  Enron's obligation is to ensure that it complies with applicable data protection laws.  To the extent that the policy only relates to employee data it will not satisfy regulatory authorities or others that Enron is complying with data protection laws in respect of any other data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Policy\n",
      "\n",
      "*     In relation to the policy itself, this does not identify or require employees to comply in a comprehensive way with the various data protection principles under the UK Act or the Directive.  Where principles are reflected, the relevant provisions are on occasion slightly misleading.  For example, the policy says that data is kept \"as long as necessary\".  The relevant data protection principle is that data should \"not be kept for longer than is necessary\" (a difference in emphasis). It seems to me that the policy is seeking largely to fulfil the requirement that individuals (employees in this case) are properly informed of the processing of their data.  This requires Enron to inform individuals of the data controller (or its representative), the purposes of processing and any other information to enable the processing to be fair.  In this regard, section 2 identifies the purposes of processing employee data.  Have checks been made to ensure this is an accurate and reasonably comprehensive description of the purposes for which employee data are processed?\n",
      "\n",
      "*     Section 2 of the policy states that Enron companies do not access sensitive data \"in making employment decisions described in (i) and (ii)\" of section 2.  To what extent is any sensitive employee data processed by Enron and to what extent have any notices or consents been given or obtained in relation to such data? \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "*     In relation to the consent sought in section 3, this does not clearly seek consent to international transfers of data.  The policy also seeks to deem consent stating that by continuing as an employee of an Enron Company\" the employee agrees to the use of his or her data as described in the policy.  It is unclear whether such a deemed consent would be effective.  To what extent is it possible to seek employees' actual consent (e.g. as part of an annual agreement by employees to abide by applicable group codes of conduct, guidelines or policies)?\n",
      "\n",
      "*     In relation to section 3, this provides that Enron may expand the uses to which employee data is put as described in this policy.  Unless employees are properly informed of or aware of any such changes, it is unlikely that any such changes will be lawful.\n",
      "\n",
      "*     In relation to section 4, this states that \"we have not established general guidelines for the use, disclosure and retention of personal data. Obviously, the purposes for which we will process personal data, the type of personal data in question and relevant regulatory requirements will guide us in such matters\".  It is unclear what the purpose of this wording is bearing in mind that it would not offer any comfort to regulators that applicable data protection laws are being complied with.  From an employee's perspective, it is not very informative.\n",
      "\n",
      "*     In the second paragraph in section 4, the policy provides that each individual who is retained by an Enron Company is responsible for ensuring that he or she takes into account the principles established by this policy.  As mentioned above the policy does not clearly address all relevant principles identified in the Directive.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Master Agreement\n",
      "\n",
      "*     The master data protection agreement only relates to intra-group transfers of employee data.  What is happening in relation to transfers of other data?\n",
      "\n",
      "*     To the extent that consents by employees to processing and international transfer of their data have been or can be obtained (e.g. through employees agreeing to a policy that addresses this issue and) then this document would not be necessary as relevant conditions permitting international transfers would have been satisfied.  To what extent can employees' consents be obtained to international transfers?\n",
      "\n",
      "*     The provisions in this document appear to be based on the European EU model contract.  However, they do not cover all the relevant provisions of the model contract and to the extent that relevant provisions are covered, they tend to be paraphrased in slightly inconsistent ways.  As a result, the question is to what extent can this document be relied on to ensure \"adequate safeguards\".  The EU decision adopting to the model contract states that \"the scope of this Decision is limited to establishing that the clauses in the Annex may be used by a controller established in the Community in order to adduce adequate safeguards within the meaning of article 26 (ii) of Directive 95/46/EC\".  The Decision does not state that similar terms adopted by particular entities will also offer adequate safeguards.  The more that the Master Agreement differs from the EU model contract, the less certainly an entity can have that there are adequate safeguards in place. \n",
      "\n",
      "*     Although many provisions in the model contract have been paraphrased in the Master Agreement, I could not find provisions in the Master Agreement corresponding with a number of provisions in the model contract, for example: clauses 2, 3, 4(b),  5(e), 6, 7(1), 9 and 11 of the model contract, and the detailed description of the processing in Appendix 1 of  the model contract.  In relation to Appendix 2, it is unclear where the following are reflected:  Appendix 2, paragraph 3;  the various information requirements in paragraph 6(a) and paragraphs 7, 8 and 9 of Appendix 2.\n",
      "\n",
      " *     In relation to the Data Importer - is Enron Corp. the only relevant data importer of employee data from Europe?\n",
      "\n",
      "*     In relation to the definitions in the master data protection agreement, it is unclear why this does not use the same definition as the model contract.   For example, the definition of \"data processor\" identifies relevant entities that are \"not a member of the corporate group\".  Why are Enron Corporate Group members/excluded from the definition of data processors? \n",
      "\n",
      "*     The master data protection agreement does not address the question of sensitive data and no definition of sensitive data is included.  Are any sensitive data transferred? \n",
      "\n",
      "*     In relation to section 3(e), this lists again the various purposes of processing employee data.  The description of relevant processing should presumably track the description in the policy to which Enron Group companies are bound.  It is therefore unclear why it is necessary to list again the various purposes of employee processing rather than simply cross-referring to the policy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "*     Paragraph 3(f) states that data exporter will be responsible for obtaining any necessary consents from the data subjects with respect of the processing of personal data.  To the extent that consents are obtained they should also cover international transfers of data.  To the extent that appropriate consents to the international transfer of data is obtained then this agreement is unnecessary.  Again therefore the question is to what extent consents to international transfer of data by employees can be or will be obtained?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "*     Clause 3(g) provides that the purposes for which data may be processed can be expanded and that the data importer will endeavour to inform the data exporter of additional purposes of using such data.  This does not conform with the strict \"purpose limitation\" in paragraph 1 of appendix 2 of the model contract.\n",
      "\n",
      "*     Whereas clause 5(b) of the model contract entitles importers to either abide by the principles identified in the model contract or the laws of the data exporter (which need to be annexed to the contract), the master agreement addresses both these requirements (see in particular paragraph 5(b)).  As a result, to this extent it imposes a potentially higher standard than that required by the model contract.  How does Enron Corp propose to comply with the laws of multiple countries as per clause 5(b)?\n",
      "\n",
      "*     Clause 9(b) provides that the \"data processor will observe the obligations of a data controller\" - this might mean for example that a data processor needs to register for data protection purposes with applicable data protection regulators.  What legal obligation is this clause seeking to address?\n",
      "\n",
      "The above comments are based on the UK Act however it is likely that similar obligations will apply in other jurisdictions.\n",
      "\n",
      " In light of the above, the key issues are as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "*     To what extent is it possible to obtain consents from employees to international transfers?  To the extent this is possible then it is likely that an intra-group agreement will not be necessary;\n",
      "*     To the extent that such an agreement is necessary, we would normally suggest that this is done substantially on the terms of the model contract.  To the extent that the relevant terms differ from the model contract then there is a risk that the relevant provisions do not offer \"adequate safeguards\" as provided by the Commission decision.  If however, Enron proposes to make transfers under the terms of the master agreement then I would suggest the master agreement should be reviewed in detail so as to ensure that to the fullest extent possible, it accurately reflects all the relevant provisions of the model contract more closely, in particular in relation to rights of relevant data subjects to enforce the contract as a party to it.\n",

Ms. Davis would like to be reinstated to work at another NEPCO job site at the rate of pay at which she was employed while working at Jenks.  She would not, however, like to go to El Dorado, as she believes the people who mistreated her now are working there.\n",

      "\n",
      "Although Ms. Davis was terminated for undermining the brass-in, brass-out rule by leaving her station, the investigation revealed several mitigating circumstances for her actions.  One, the power was out completely.  She previously had indicated a fear of working on the site at night, but she had no flashlight or any way to reach anybody from the site.  Second, there is the contention that the security guard came by and told her to leave.  Third, this offense is not a terminable one under the NEPCO progressive discipline policy (although of course that policy provides for flexibility based on the circumstances).  Ben's investigation revealed some other reasons why he was concerned about how Ms. Davis had been treated; he can provide detail, if we want.  \n",

      "I suggest we talk first. Call me on the following cell phone 713-962-1490. The difficulty I suspect is that people are understandably uncertain of the unknown, but in 10 days we will have everything nailed down. Additionally, people, it would appear, seem to be making certain assumptions about the estate which I believe are false. I can't see the estate continuing to sponsor green cards, or in maintaining the cash balance plan, at least in the form of the past, etc., etc., Bankruptcy isn't pleasant.\n",
      " \n",
      "I would however, like to avoid selling NETCO at the estate's expense, as difficult as this may be.\n",
      " \n",
      "The main points we need to communicate and build around would be;\n",
      " \n",
      "Salary - Everyone we talked to has indicated a willingness to keep them at least at current levels\n",
      "Job responsibility - This is entirely Jay and Jenny's call. If they see a person as necessary to do a different job, they need to explain that. Typically, people should be transferring in exactly the same position as the current have, that would be the whole point of why NETCO needs them. Clearly NETCO will be a subsidiary of a large bank and as such will not have quite the same prominence it enjoyed with Enron pre-bankruptcy. Unfortunately, that is lost forever.\n",
      "Bonus - Plan two main counter parties have agreed is more generous than Enron's current arrangement, if we perform.\n",
      "Retention - Two main counter parties have agreed in principle to a pool of cash to be paid to the 700 people in NETCO who didn't get anything in Nov. This would be paid as soon as practical after signing in exchange for a commitment for them to stay for 3 months or so otherwise they will have to repay it.\n",
      "Benefits - These will differ depending on who buys us. However, it each case they have comparable benefits but they are obviously different. On the specific point of pension plan, they have plans that require some vesting period but again the 2 main counter parties have agreed that they will take Enron service into account (i.e. if they have 5 years with Enron and their plan requires 5 years service to vest they will vest immediately, but obviously will get just their first years contribution). Now is someone is 4 years in with Enron, I recognise this is not a great answer, but has to be contrasted with how long there is a position in the estate for them (i.e. is there a job for another 12 months). The last point concentrates too much on negative aspects of what may happen to estate, so I would prefer to avoid too much innuendo here.\n",
      "VISA's - we have a plan to switch all H1b visa's within 24 hours. This is apparently straight forward and Neil and Tim Callahan and I have discussed logistics with one of the counter-parties in some detail. On L1's, these will take up to 3 weeks to switch to H1's. Of the 70 people identified who have VISA's only about 7 or 8 have L1's. Tindall and Foster tell us this will not pose a problem and again we have discussed this with the one of the counter-parties who have agreed our approach. These people should avoid traveling outside US in this 3 weeks, but according to Tindall and Foster will be legit.\n",
      "Green Cards - No easy solution. Essentially these will have to start from scratch. The counter parties have not at this stage told us whether they will support new applications. However, bear in mind I do not believe the Enron estate will continue with green cards, although this has not been officially proclaimed.\n",
      "Expat Terms - These will probably be honored by the new company, although each counter-party has indicated a desire to \"normalise\" the terms with those of their own company, over time.\n",
      "Employment Agreements - We have identified 179 across NETCO. The estate plans to transfer these to the buyer, but it is clear that each prospective buyer does not readily accept this as a term of the deal. As such my working assumption is that the offer letters each NETCO ee receives circa Jan 12, will supercede all previous terms including employment agreements, that individuals may have had. Specifically, I expect that the new employer will not honor future equity, cash retention, target bonus or severance provisions that may be in people contracts. Clearly, there may be some negotiation here.\n",
      " \n",
      "Now, we have other things like Title's, PRC, Promotion dates, Salary reviews, project bonuses, All employee stock option programs, etc., to figure out, but I think it unlikely that these will be unpleasant surprises, after all the new employer will be probably one of the 5 biggest investments banks in the world and we almost certainly benchmarked our processes on them over the last 10 years. There may even be an ability to transfer (after a while to a different part of their organisation, if they have an internal posting process).\n",
      " \n",
      "As to process from here, we want to identify those who DON\"T want to go and why. I want to avoid ANYONE receiving an \"offer\" to switch and NOT accepting it. As I mention above, many of the terms of the \"offer\" are unlikely to be a huge surprise, and if people have genuine concerns I want to switch them out now for someone who does want to go. We should have 100% acceptance, not because of bullying or ultimatum's but because we figure out early who had concerns, solving them or switching them out for someone else.\n",

      "I talked with Jay on Friday because I was concerned that Steve Stock and Zhiyong Wei, two senior IT guys, had concerns about Netco and were asking me why it wouldn't be better to stay on the Estate. My whole purpose in discussing this with Jay was to make sure he was aware of their feelings. However, it seems that some of  this miscommunication was and has become an exagerration.\n",
      " \n",
      "I attended Beth Perlman's floor meeting when she communciated the difference between the Estate and Netco. She said that Jay Webb would be talking with everyone that had been identified to go to Netco and that she would be talking with individuals that would be staying on with the Estate. She did tell the employees that if they were identified to go to Netco and had a problem with this then they should talk with her and HR. She also said upon deal closure if the Netco employees receive offers and they turn them down it would be a voluntary resignation.  She urged them to please talk with us now if there are any concerns. She also said that we have requested to offer same salaries, to bridge service, and to pay retention bonuses at the time of deal closure. In addition, she communicated that we have limited information but we would update the group when more became available. \n",
      " \n",
      "It was never communicated that if they went to Netco they would lose their visas, etc. I have received a lot of questions and concerns about visas but my response is that we are working on this and we have it covered. I have also heard a lot of concerns on the Cash Balance Plan and my response is that we have asked to bridge employees service but we will not know until deal closure.  I have stressed that Netco wants to keep intellectual capital and will most likely make a fair offer to keep employees whole. \n",
      " \n",
      "In talking with employees identified to go to Netco their biggest concerns are 1) they are not guranteed same benefits, salary, bonus, etc and they feel like they will be bullied into accepting the Netco offer and 2)they are on visas and in the green card process and don't want to start the process over because they don't have enough time left on their visa. I have talked to Neil Davies about the second concern and we are trying to come up with some options. I have talked with the concerned employees about what we requested but I am not sure how else to alleviate their concerns. \n",

If it's getting \"offered a lower paid job\" that simply isn't in the plans of the NETCO transaction, unless Beth, Jay and Jenny are wanting to do that before the transaction (can't think why they would). Bottom-line, people will transfer to a SOLVENT, Aplus credit rated company, on the same salary on perform whatever job Jay and Jenny ask them to. The benefits will switch, but we already know that counter parties benefits are fairly generous even by our standards, and they will agree to bridge service for vesting in pension et al. Bonus plan should be very good (current proposals are slightly better than Enron's). Titles, promotions, stock awards and base pay raises we aren't sure about just yet, but my working assumption is they will follow Enron previous practice until agreed otherwise.\n",

Even though my situation is not an executive situation, Enron has been my life for 14 years.  I have been a dedicated, hard-working, employee that did not in any way deserve to be forced out of a position because the bosses got along better with other individuals in the group.   I questioned procedures, and shared my knowledge, came up with better ways of doing things and look where it got me.  I was not given the recognition I deserved because of corrupt individuals that were afraid for their own jobs,  now I am leaving and they get to stay.
